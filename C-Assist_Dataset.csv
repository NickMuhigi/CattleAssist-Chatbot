What is the key advantage of using a 'Continuous Grazing' system over rotational grazing?,It requires the least amount of labor and infrastructure (fencing/water points) but usually leads to poorer pasture management.
What is the function of Copper Sulfate in a hoof health program?,It is a highly effective antiseptic and drying agent commonly used in footbaths to treat and prevent Digital Dermatitis and Foot Rot.
What is the primary benefit of using a 'Maturity Grade' in beef carcass evaluation?,"It estimates the physiological age of the animal, as older animals have tougher meat, with grades ranging from $	ext{A}$ (youngest) to $	ext{E}$ (oldest)."
"What is the main risk associated with a cow consuming Toxic Weeds (e.g., Water Hemlock)?","Even a small amount can cause acute, rapid poisoning leading to central nervous system damage, convulsions, and death."
What are two signs that a calf may be suffering from a Rib Fracture due to difficult calving?,"1) Labored, shallow breathing and pain upon movement. 2) Reluctance to stand or nurse on the side of the injury."
What is the purpose of using a 'Rumination Collar' or sensor in dairy cattle?,"It tracks the cow's time spent chewing cud; a sudden drop in rumination time is an early indicator of illness, stress, or digestive upset."
What is the key characteristic of a 'Jersey' cow's milk compared to a Holstein's?,"Jersey milk has a significantly higher concentration of butterfat and protein, making it ideal for cheese and butter production."
What is the primary function of Tetanus Antitoxin administered to a calf after castration or dehorning?,"It provides immediate, short-term passive immunity against the Tetanus toxin, which is crucial if the wound is deep or dirty."
What is the key difference between 'Pre-conditioning' and 'Backgrounding' in beef cattle?,"Pre-conditioning occurs before weaning (vaccination, dehorning). Backgrounding occurs after weaning (feeding them on a forage-based diet before the feedlot)."
What is the purpose of a 'Tail Paint' heat detection system?,"The paint is applied to the tailhead; if the cow is mounted, the paint is rubbed off, providing a clear, visual indicator of standing heat."
What is the primary benefit of using a 'Crowding Gate' in a working corral?,"The gate pivots to reduce the pen size, gently and safely applying pressure to encourage a group of cattle to move toward the chute entrance."
What is the common name for the swelling caused by the bacteria Actinobacillus lignieresii?,"Wooden Tongue, a sporadic infection that causes a hard, woody, non-movable swelling of the tongue, making eating difficult."
What is the key difference between a 'Dressing Percentage' and 'Yield Grade' in carcass evaluation?,"Dressing Percentage is the carcass weight relative to live weight. Yield Grade is the predicted amount of boneless, lean retail meat."
What is the main advantage of using 'Small Square Bales' over large round bales for hay storage?,"Small square bales are easier to handle manually, store inside, and feed to individual animals or small groups with less waste."
"What is the recommended maximum percentage of Non-Protein Nitrogen (NPN), like urea, in an adult cattle ration?",NPN should generally not exceed $1\%$ of the total diet or $33\%$ of the total dietary protein to prevent toxicity.
What is the purpose of a 'Colostrum Refractometer' (Brix Refractometer) in calf management?,"It is used to quickly measure the quality of colostrum by determining the concentration of immunoglobulins (antibodies), with $>22\%$ being excellent."
What is the main health risk associated with cattle grazing on Sweet Clover hay that has become moldy?,"The mold converts Coumarin in the clover into Dicoumarol, which acts as a powerful anticoagulant, causing severe internal hemorrhaging."
What is the key difference between a 'Genomic' EPD and a traditional EPD?,"A Genomic EPD uses DNA marker information in addition to pedigree and performance data, resulting in a more accurate prediction for young animals."
What is the primary method of transmission for Salmonellosis (a major cause of scours)?,"It is transmitted via the fecal-oral route by ingesting feed or water contaminated with the bacteria, often from infected carrier animals."
What is the benefit of administering an Intravenous (IV) Fluid drench to a severely dehydrated calf?,IV fluids provide rapid rehydration and immediately correct severe acidosis that oral electrolytes cannot fix quickly enough.
What is the main purpose of a 'Sorting Pen' adjacent to a working chute?,"It is the final pen used to separate animals (e.g., into groups for culling, re-vaccination, or return to pasture) immediately after they exit the chute."
What is the significance of a high 'Frame Score' in beef cattle breeding?,"A high Frame Score (e.g., 7-9) indicates a larger, later-maturing animal that will reach a heavier final slaughter weight, but requires a longer feeding period."
